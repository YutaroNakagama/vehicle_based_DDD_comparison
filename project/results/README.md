# results/ directory

This directory stores **experiment outputs** including metrics, distance matrices, rankings, and analysis results.  
Each subdirectory corresponds to a specific type of result.

## Structure
```

results/
â”œâ”€â”€ analysis/        # Aggregated analysis outputs (tables, plots, correlations)
â”œâ”€â”€ distances/       # Computed distance matrices (NumPy .npy files, JSON metadata)
â”œâ”€â”€ dtw/             # Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) distance results
â”œâ”€â”€ group\_distances/ # Distances grouped by subject clusters
â”œâ”€â”€ mmd/             # Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) results
â”œâ”€â”€ ranks/           # Ranking results (CSV)
â”œâ”€â”€ ranks10/         # Ranking results (10-subject experiments)
â”œâ”€â”€ ranks20/         # Ranking results (20-subject experiments)
â””â”€â”€ wasserstein/     # Wasserstein distance results

```

## Notes
- **analysis/** contains aggregated CSVs and figures (e.g., radar charts, summary tables).  
- **distances/** stores core distance matrices (`*_matrix.npy`) and subject mapping files (`subjects.json`).  
- **dtw/**, **mmd/**, **wasserstein/** are separated for clarity by metric type.  
- **ranks/**, **ranks10/**, **ranks20/** hold ranking-based evaluations.

## Tips
- Always record metadata alongside results (e.g., config, seed, sample size) to ensure reproducibility.  
- Use `project/misc/aggregate_*.py` scripts to consolidate multiple result files.
