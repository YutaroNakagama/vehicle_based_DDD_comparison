# Lightweight Vehicle-Based DDD Model Comparison

## Overview
This repository focuses on benchmarking **lightweight Driver Drowsiness Detection (DDD) models** using **vehicle-based features**. The goal is to compare the efficiency and performance of various lightweight ML models, optimized through **pruning, quantization, and other techniques**.

## Dataset
We utilize the **open dataset** from _Multi-modal Data Acquisition Platform for Behavioral Evaluation_ (Aygun et al., 2024). The dataset contains:
- Vehicle-based features (steering, acceleration, etc.)
- EEG signals
- Physiological data (heart rate, GSR, etc.)
- Labels for driver drowsiness states

**DOI:** [10.7910/DVN/HMZ5RG](https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/HMZ5RG)
<!-- need to explain how to download complete dataset via API -->

### Preprocessing
- Vehicle-based signals are filtered and normalized.
- EEG data is transformed into meaningful frequency components.
- Labels are categorized into drowsiness levels based on predefined thresholds.

<!--
## ⚙️ Setup
To set up the environment, install the required dependencies:

```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
-->

Recommended Python version: **3.8+**

## Model Comparison
We compare different lightweight models optimized for efficiency:

<!--
| Model | Pruning | Quantization | Params | Accuracy |
|--------|---------|-------------|--------|----------|
| Baseline DNN | ❌ | ❌ | 1M | 85% |
| Pruned DNN | ✅ | ❌ | 500K | 84% |
| Quantized DNN | ❌ | ✅ | 250K | 83% |
| Pruned + Quantized | ✅ | ✅ | 200K | 82% |
-->

### Compared DDD Approaches
We compare our models against the following established DDD methods:
1. **Arefnezhad et al. (2019)** - Driver drowsiness detection using steering wheel data and adaptive neuro-fuzzy feature selection. [DOI: 10.3390/s19040943]
2. **Zhao et al. (2009)** - Detecting driver’s drowsiness using multiwavelet packet energy spectrum. 
3. **Wang et al. (2022)** - Driver distraction detection based on vehicle dynamics using naturalistic driving data. [DOI: 10.1016/j.trc.2022.103561]

## Usage
### Training a Model
```sh
python train.py --model pruned_dnn --epochs 50
```

### Evaluating a Model
```sh
python evaluate.py --model pruned_dnn
```

### Running Inference
```sh
python infer.py --input sample_data.csv
```

## Results & Visualization
The model performance is evaluated using **AUC, accuracy, and inference time**. Results are plotted for better interpretability.

```sh
python plot_results.py
```
