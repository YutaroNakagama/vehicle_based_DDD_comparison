# jobs/ directory

This directory contains batch job scripts and output logs for cluster processing.

- `pbs.sh`: Main PBS batch script for preprocessing jobs. This is the only `.sh` file tracked by Git.
- `preprocess_mp.o*`: Output log files generated by cluster jobs.
- `Miniconda3-py313_25.3.1-1-Linux-x86_64.sh`: Installer script for Miniconda (not version-controlled; you may want to remove it if not needed).

## Notes
- All log files and other `.sh` files are ignored by `.gitignore` except for `pbs.sh`.
- See the main repository README for details on job submission and processing.

## How to use

1. Edit `pbs.sh` for your job settings.
2. Submit jobs using the cluster's PBS system.
3. Output logs (e.g., `preprocess_mp.o12345`) will appear here after execution.
